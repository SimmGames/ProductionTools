# ProductionTools
This project holds a handful of different tools for development in Unity3D.
All of these tools are primarly for my own personal developer library, but they're free to use with the MIT Liscense.

# [Downloads!](https://github.com/SimmGames/ProductionTools/tags)
All of the different sections are kept in the tags section. They're just Unity Packages and can be added to your project by dragging and dropping the *.unitypackage* file into Unity.

# What's In This Project
Each project will have it's own Wiki page for both Scripting information and for the User Manual.
* Dialogue System ([Wiki](https://github.com/SimmGames/ProductionTools/wiki/Dialogue-System)) - This package allows for an in-editor solution to creating, editing, and storing Dialogue Trees.
